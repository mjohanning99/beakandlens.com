  <h2>07.01.2024 — Happy New Year!</h2>
  <p>Happy New Year, everyone! There have not been a lot of updates lately due to the fact that it has been raining nigh-constantly here and I have, thus, been unable to go outside and take photos (my equipment is not waterproof, unfortunately). However, the weather has started clearning up a little bit and I have, once again, been able to start photographing birds. I will also be trying to update the site a bit more by adding things such as a gallery sorted by date (month and year) starting in 2024. </p>

  <h2>27.09.2023 — A new home</h2>
  <p>Hello and welcome to the new home of beakandlens.com! I initially created this site in April of 2023 to host my bird and wildlife photography using the open-source project called <q>Piwigo</q>; and even though Piwigo worked, it didn’t work quite as well as I had hoped it would. Not only is it way too bloated for my use case, it also did not have a lot of functionality I needed, such as, for example, the ability to set custom pages (very important for even simple but legally required things such as an <q>Impressum</q>). This meant that I was required to download extensions that added said functionality, but it never worked quite as I had hoped it would.</p>

  <p>A few months later, in September 2023, I decided to rent a new VPS and cancel the old one. This meant that beakandlens.com would also have to move — a process which was a bit more convoluted in Piwigo than I had hoped it would be. This, in addition to the fact that I had been wanting to move my photos to a different platform, made me decide to ditch Piwigo and look for something else that was less bloated and allowed me to simply drag and drop my photos into a folder and have them be displayed on my website. </p>

  <p>Unfortunately, however, actually finding something that did exactly what I wanted was very difficult. I did find a handful of very promising tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/waynezhang/foto">foto</a> (link to a GitHub repo) or <a href="https://github.com/moul-co/moul">moul</a> (link to a GitHub repo). These, however, had other issue that made me not want to use them. </p>

  <p>I, therefore, set out to make my own site by slightly adapting the CSS that I had already made for my other website, <a href="https://ancient-greek.net">ancient-greek.net</a> and by using Jekyll to make it a little easier. </p>

  <p>And that is the current state of things. This website is still being worked on nearly daily and new things are being added constantly.</p>
