intro: You have reached the equipment information page on my website. Here, you will be able to find information about (and photos of) my photography equipment. I use a variety of lenses and cameras for my photography and will most likely be upgrading equipment down the line as well. So be sure to check back occasionally to see if a new piece of equipment has joined my stash!

  <p>For bird photography, I typically just use one camera and one lens, namely the Canon EOS R10 and the RF 100-400 mm f/5.6-8 lens. In the near future, I will also be buying a Sigma 150-600 mm lens to complement the RF 100-400. The main appeal of this setup is its unbelievably light weight; I can easily and very comfortably carry this camera and lens combination all day without any problems. </p>
  
  <p>My previous setup (a Canon 70D and a 150-600 mm Tamron lens) did make my arms tired after being out with it all day. Additionally, my Tamron, unfortunately, had a couple of issues with its autofocus and especially its stabilisation so I had to send it back for a full refund after a few months of using it. </p>
